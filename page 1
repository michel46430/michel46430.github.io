    <p> One of my favorite hobbies is music! I grew up taking choir classes and listening to a lot of different kinds. My favorite genres are Progressive Metal and Korean Pop.</p>
    <p>I also go to concerts to see the groups I like live. This year I'll have gone to at least eight concerts. I usually only go to metal and kpop concerts, but I did see one comedy band this year.</p>
