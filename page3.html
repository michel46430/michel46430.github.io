    <p>I mainly watch anime and cartoons, but I occasionally enjoy other shows my friends recommend. My favorite shows have a bit of action, fantasy and suspense elements.</p>
    <p>The last shows I watched were <i>The Summer Hikaru Died,</i> <i>Dan Dan Dan,</i> and <i>The Apothecary Diaries.</i></p>
    <p>The last western show I watched (as in not anime or a korean drama) was <i>Reservation Dogs,</i> which is about Native American teens who live on a reservation in Oklahoma.</p>
