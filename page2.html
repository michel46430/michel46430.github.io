    <p>I play two main games: Warframe and Animal Crossing.</p>
    <p>Warframe is an online first person shooter game. I mainly play this with my brother to spend time with him. He currently lives in Arizona, so we can't visit or see each other often other than online.</p>
    <p>Animal Crossing is a solo game that I play to relax. I think it's considered a farming simulator, but there are other elements involved that I find more enjoyable than the average farming simulator.</p>
